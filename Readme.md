# Welcome Art and Hacks with DarknetNG

First you start on the bottom right hand side

Take your tape and go from the VCC one to the bottom of the yellow line

Carefully peel the paper from the back of the copper tape

Place the topmost of the copper tape underneath the VCC one line

Continue to pull the paper off of the tape until you reach the bottom touching the yellow line

You can then take the spoon or your fingernail to flatten the tape

Next you're going we will be laying another strip from the ground to the top right corner

We will just be doing it another flat piece on the top right corner to the top of the gnd

We will use the same technique to remove the tape from the paper

Place the starter sign down next to the GND up to the top right hand corner

Take a fingernail or spoon and flatten out the copper tape

Next is the top bar

This one you need to make a bit longer so you can fold some back on itself.

After you have folded one side back on itself measure along the yellow line and cut or tear the copper tape to the proper length

By pre-folding that end it will make it easier to stick on itself.

After that put the copper to copper connection in the top corner. Using the paper to pull the copper tape off finish the top line

because the copper is not conductive on both sides it's very important that you make sure you have the file folded over enough and touching your bottom bar.

After the top bar is completed we're going to do the same for the bottom

By taking a piece of the paper tape you know you can fold back the copper to the right size

Next peel the copper tape off of the paper
Fold over the tape sticky side the sticky side on the very end
Place the copper to copper touching and lay out the bottom line cutting off or tearing off the copper at the bottom left hand side

Use your spoon or fingernail to flatten copper tape
