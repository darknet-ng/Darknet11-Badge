Steps:

First you start on the bottom right hand side

Take your tape and go from the VCC one to the bottom of the yellow line

Carefully peel the paper from the back of the copper tape

Place the topmost of the copper tape underneath the VCC one line

Continue to pull the paper off of the tape until you reach the bottom touching the yellow line

You can then take the spoon or your fingernail to flatten the tape

Next you're going we will be laying another strip from the ground to the top right corner

We will just be doing it another flat piece on the top right corner to the top of the gnd

We will use the same technique to remove the tape from the paper

Place the starter sign down next to the GND up to the top right hand corner

Take a fingernail or spoon and flatten out the copper tape

Next is the top bar

This one you need to make a bit longer so you can fold some back on itself.

After you have folded one side back on itself measure along the yellow line and cut or tear the copper tape to the proper length

By pre-folding that end it will make it easier to stick on itself.

After that put the copper to copper connection in the top corner. Using the paper to pull the copper tape off finish the top line

because the copper is not conductive on both sides it's very important that you make sure you have the file folded over enough and touching your bottom bar.

After the top bar is completed we're going to do the same for the bottom

By taking a piece of the paper tape you know you can fold back the copper to the right size

Next peel the copper tape off of the paper
Fold over the tape sticky side the sticky side on the very end
Place the copper to copper touching and lay out the bottom line cutting off or tearing off the copper at the bottom left hand side

Use your spoon or fingernail to flatten copper tape

Next we're going to do the top center Bar
We will grab the tape fold it over on one end,
Place the copper to copper on the top side center and follow the yellow line down

You must make sure there's enough overlap under the copper tape otherwise you will not have a good electrical connection

If you don't have enough of a connection you can carefully remove the copper tape and put a new strip down

Next we're going to do the middle center of the badge

This is an easy flat strip going from the bottom green circle of the LED one connecting to the green top circle of r1 take your spoon and flatten it out.

Next we take the bottom center,
Fold back one end
Place the folded side towards the bottom bar
Then follow the yellow line up to the greens bottom circle of r1, cut or rip the copper tape,
Then flatten with the spoon

Next we take the top left 
Again fold over one side,
Place the folded side in the top right corner and follow the yellow line down to the top green LED 2 circle

Next we do the top left connection from led 2 to LED 3
This is a flat connection, from LED two bottom green circle to LED 3 top green circle

Next connection is a flat connection to the LED 3 bottom green circle to the r2 top green circle

The last strip for the first level is from The bottom bar to the r2 green circle

Start with folding back the end,
Placing the folded sign down at the bottom for an electrical connection, then going to the bottom r2 green circle and then use a flat spoon to flatten your connection.

Your base layer of copper traces should now be completed with a total of six foldovers.
These will be located on the top and bottom bars

Next you want to choose an LED for the LED one position

Using the reference card on the back,
Place your short side leg to the top of the card.
This is your cathode, which represents the negative side of the LED.

You may also want to cut down your legs so they're not so long, if you do this you will need to pay attention to the internals of the LED to make sure you have the larger metal piece inside pointing to the north which also represents your cathode and short side.

Next we need to connect your LED to the top center piece,
Fold back one side onto itself, and place the copper side down on top of the LED leg, 
Applying More tape to hold that side down going towards the top

Next we're going to secure the bottom leg of the LED by folding back tape on itself then applying that to the bottom leg copper to copper

Then we come to the resistor in the center
We will be using the brown brown gold resistor,
We'll want to clip the legs down by about half
Next will want to use the tape to pull back on itself, make sure you have sufficient overlapping of copper to copper to make sure there's a good connection.

He'll do the same thing on the bottom side by folding over the piece.

You'll do the same for the following left side of the badge
